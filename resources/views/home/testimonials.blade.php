                           	It has been a great year being a student of Vikram’s English Academy.I have received constant positive vibes to perform well. Vikramjit Sir is a great mentor as well as a fab teacher. He was there to help me clear all my doubts a night before the board exams even at 2 am. The regular test series made me study regularly, perform well and boost up my confidence. English was not my cup of tea but the motivation, support and guidance that I received from the Academy helped me a lot to work hard, pass out with flying colours and keep up to the expectations of everyone. Thank You VEA.<br>

						 Vikramjit Sir has always been a pillar of support for my daughter. I had been really worried about her English in 9th before joining VEA but ever since she joined Vikram’s English Academy there was an increase by 10 marks in English in her prelims in 10th. Sir always helped her with all her doubts whenever needed. I am really happy with her score in tenth and I really thank the academy for their guidance!

						Vikram's English Academy is the ultimate place for learning English. I joined Vikram's English academy in 9th standard and since that day, my life has drastically changed. Vikram Sir makes learning so interesting that studying English is fun and enjoyable. I never wanted to miss any of his lectures. His innovative technique of teaching and jovial nature makes learning a very fascinating and delightful journey. He brought in the concept of learning grammar through music which made grammar very simple to learn. He makes our minds active so that we don't just memorize the facts and rules but understand the logic behind everything. He teaches uslessons in the form of storiesbringing the characters to life.<br>
						The Shakespeare part of the literature which is The Merchant of Venice for a better understanding. He not only taught us the reasons behind the dialogues but also showed us the entire play of the merchant of Venice for a better understanding.He managed the tests and prelims very efficiently and thoughtfully and also arranged pre-prelims so that we get to revise the entire portion in different parts in an easier way. The doubt solving was amazing. He handled our problems so tactfully that we were ready and fearless about the board exams.<br>
						Besides being a great teacher, he is also a good human being and a very good mentor. He gave me enough moral support and encouragement after the English language board exam so that I could keep up my momentum in the remaining exams.
						He organized a ‘Milestone’ lecture for us wherein he taught us to dream; dream for our goals. He told us that with hard work and perseverance, anything is possible. I dreamt of achieving my goal and I got it.<br>
						His contribution in my life can't be expressed in words. 'A good teacher is like a candle. It consumes itself to light the way for others.' Thank you sir for all that you have done for us.

                        <li>My son joined Vikram's English Academy in the 9std and studied there for 2 years. We had a wonderful experience at the Academy.My son  used to wait eagerly for the day for English class.He enjoyed learning from Vikramjit sir and always shared his feelings and experiences with me. Vikramjit sir is strict and very particular about time,attendance and homework but at the same time he is polite, jovial and friendly.He is very close to students so he knows their problems very well due to experience of many years. He solves their problems very tactfully and guides them well along with best academic teaching. His efforts take his students far ahead .He is very dedicated to his teaching profession.His guidance,motivation has helped my son a lot. We will always remember him as one of the best teachers.Best part of his coaching is not limited for the board exam but he prepares them to face the world with powerful English language.<br>

							To write a testimony for Vikramjit sir is no meagre task because no set of words can aptly describe a teacher absolutely perfect in every way. He has been a leader, friend, and guide for not only English but for life as well. His classes were the one thing I looked forward to every week as they were the occasions when I could think broader than I ever imagined I would be able to. Humor was a part of each lecture and kept students engrossed beyond any ordinary teacher's capacity. The Merchant of Venice was made a one man play by this one man army. Every sentence could be imagined and visualized, every doubt cleared and every worry rid of and this is just a trailer of the blockbuster that is Vikramjit sir.  It will be a most wonderful ride for every student under him. The success of a teacher lies in his ability to make a child love a subject he never dreamt of and that is what Vikramjit sir succeeds in. <br>

							My son joined Vikram's English Academy in the 9th std and studied there for 2 years. When we met Vikramjit sir during orientation session, I knew Prasann was in safe hands as we heard him explain "fish-plates" pictorially! The rest was history as the teacher-student relationship blossomed and the interest in "English" subject was instilled. Enjoyment and wonderful experience of learning a language in any student can be only if the teacher is passionate of the subject which Vikramjit sir is an example. Hats off to Vikramjit sir for his dedication and love towards his students!

                            Vikramjit Sir doing full justice to this quote was nothing less than a superhero for his students. The manner in which he brought Antonio, Bassanio and other various characters of the Merchant of Venice alive was fascinating more than anything else. He made sure that the students who entered his classroom would depart learning something new about the ways of life..<br>
							English used to give me jitters but once I became a part of this academy, Sir made sure that I gave English those jitters. I have been fortunate enough to be a part of this academy for a period of two years. The wonderful journey of love, compassion and harmony cannot be explained in writing. From the meeting of the Indian superheroes to the Milestone lecture and finally ending the journey with me becoming one of the VEAnners of this academy, the journey has been a memorable one.Thank you sir for showing your faith, support and belief in me!

						“What is a teacher? It isn’t someone who just teaches something but inspires the student to give her best in order to discover what she already knows.” . <br>
                            <br>
                            This quote correctly summarizes the personality of Vikramjit Sir. I have been associated with Vikram’s English Academy since my ninth grade. My experience has been beyond my imagination. I have not only learnt the lessons of English but also lessons of life. The way Vikramjit Sir teaches is mindboggling. There hasn’t been a single lecture inn two years where I have had to look at my watch or wait for it to get over. While teaching, Sir can read our mind by the look on the face and exactly understands when we have not understood a particular topic. He explains it in different ways till he is satisfied that we have finally got it. Sir’s usage of jokes and puns make the lecture fun. The doubt solving sessions are very helpful and help us to get a clear idea of all the concepts. The Pre-Prelims and the Prelims conducted indicate the hardwork sir has done for us and was reflected in the marks we scored.<br>
							Vikram’s English Academy is like my family and holds a very important place in my heart. I cannot forget the words Vikramjit Sir spoke during the Milestone Lecture. He changed me as a person that day. He guides our lives towards the right path when we need it the most. He has not only helped us academically but also taught us moral lessons of life. I fall short of words to describe Sir. He is my inspiration, my mentor and a hero to all his students. He is not just a teacher but an awareness I have been blessed to have.<br>

						    “A good teacher is the one who heals ignorance and an artist who inspires creativity”. <br>

                            I have been associated with this prestigious institution since my ninth grade and I used to look dotingly to each and every class. English was never my cup of tea but Vikramjit Sir made me fall in love with the subject specially ‘The Merchant of Venice’. All these stories, drama and poems were well explained by Sir and have been deeply placed in my mind. His teaching has touched my heart and I would never forget it in my life. <br>
							Vikramjit Sir is not only an inspiration but also a teacher. His ‘Milestone’ lecture was a priceless gift that boosted me with energy hope and confidence and changed my perspective towards life. It takes a big heart to shape young minds.<br>
							I don’t think anyone would have taught us English better than Sir. All grammar rules in a song form, Merchant of Venice as a drama, voice modulation and witty puns really lifted our spirits. The VEA Literature and grammar books were amazing and have all the concepts in a question answer form making learning easy. The amount of exams taken throughout the year made it a cakewalk to write the Board exams. To the outside world he may be a teacher but for us he is true hero. He makes so many sets of question papers on his own, personally attends doubts of all the students and on the day prior to the board exam he is ready to clear doubts even at 4am in the morning. <br>
							Vikramjit Sir is a loving motivational teacher and a true English wizard because of whom ordinary students dream of doing extraordinary things.<br>

						Kavisha could score 94 in English and this wouldn’t have been possible without the support of Vikram’s English Academy. <br>
						It was always bliss to see Kavisha smiling from the class and the lectures were always an enjoyment during her busy schedule in preparation for the boards. Honestly I have never seen a hardworking teacher as Vikramjit Sir who personally attends to hundreds of students, wakes up the whole night to solve their doubts and still never gets tired and keeps on smiling. Studying with Vikram’s English Academy not only improved Kavisha’s English but also filled her with confidence to achieve the best at boards.</br><br>

						I joined Vikram Sir's English Academy in grade 8.I have been for 3 years with Vikram sir and has been a unique learning experience for me. His teaching is legendary. He is an excellent teacher. He explains things that students find it hard to understand and simplify them so that we could understand better. He is also good at making the lesson more fun and interesting by using music and audio visual aids. The cherry on the cake is that he makes us feel at ease and we find we can do our work in a more cheerful manner. Without his support and trust in me I could not have reached this great score 94/100.He has been a great mentor a supporter father character in my life. I am proud to be a part of Vikram's English Academy. It's the best one can ever get.<br>

						I joined the Vikram’s English Academy in my 9th grade and I was a little uncomfortable at the beginning of the 9th grade because it was a new place for me. I still remember the first lecture at Vikram’s English Academy wherein Vikramjit sir was telling us about dealing with different accents which people have while speaking English.<br>
						I had never thought that I would be able to score 93/100 in English and it was all because of Vikram sir’s constant guidance and support. The prelims held in the class were in such a manner that we were able to concentrate on each and every chapter and even on our smallest mistakes that we often make while writing English. English was never like a subject for me while studying in Vikram sir’s Academy. It was like a game or I can say it was like a stress release therapy for me.<br>
						Vikram sir made it a point that we students should never feel English as a burden while studying ‘The Merchant of Venice’. In the beginning The Merchant of Venice was really a tough thing for me and I used to hate that, but the way Vikram sir dramatized the book, it came under the category of one of the simplest things which I could do. And my parents found it unbelievable that my friends and I ended up even doing a drama on stage in our School on The Merchant of Venice. The dialogues came easily for me because of my experience at the Academy.<br>
						Vikram sir made it a point that each and every student stayed focused on this subject.We even solved different schools’ prelim papers and we students got the knack and knowledge of each and every question that could be asked differently. The tests that were held too were very helpful to us. The answer sheet correction was in such a way that we got to know all our weak points.<br>
						The ‘MILESTONE’ lecture was a life changing lecture for me. I still remember each and every point that Vikram Sir spoke on that day like the example of Shah Rukh Khan, the Dabbawalas etc. Vikram Sir too gave his own example in which we could imagine ourselves overcoming the difficult situations and dreaming of achieving something enriching.<br>
						Another interesting thing was Vikram Sir using examples of songs for making grammar easy. There were many revision lectures arranged wherein we cleared our doubts regarding grammar, Merchant of Venice etc. Vikram Sir also uploaded many idioms and proverbs on the website which could help us deal with the quality of our essays & letter writing. Vikram Sir was personally available before and on the day of the exam. We were allowed to call him on his cell phone for clearing our doubts. He even met some students on the day of the exam to wish us all the best.<br>
						I had got 54 in English in the 9th grade and then a jump to 93 in English making a difference of 39 marks just because of the phenomenon called “Vikramjit Sir”. I thank Sir and Vikram’s English Academy for everything.<br>

							Whenever I think about Vikram Sir's English lectures the first image that pops in my mind is of him enacting the monologue of Launcelot Gobbo, using his laptop to show us various topic related images, talking with a nasal tone and doing everything he can in order to help us visualize the characters the way they are meant to be visualized.
Although Vikram Sir puts in tremendous efforts to come up with the best explanation to things, his way of teaching is as effortless and unique as it could get. Difficult concepts seem easy when he teaches them.

                                He understands the importance of concentrating on smaller things to be able to make a big difference which is why instead of directly being evaluated on the entire syllabus at once we are made to write several aptly spaced smaller tests first. Personally, it has helped me extremely in understanding my shortcomings.Be it revision or doubt clearing, I have never seen Sir grow tired of repeating himself regardless of what time of the day (or night) it is.
By arranging the milestone lecture and sharing is own experiences as a student he made us believe in the fact that perseverance makes everything possible.
More than our hardwork it is his effort that has made all his students stand where they are, where they hardly imagined they could reach.
