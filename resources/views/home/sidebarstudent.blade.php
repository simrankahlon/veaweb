						<br>It has been a great year being a student of Vikram’s English Academy.I have received constant positive vibes to perform well.
						Vikramjit Sir is a great mentor as well as a fab teacher. He was there to help me clear all my doubts a night before the board exams even at 2 am.The regular test series made me study regularly, perform well and boost up my confidence. English was not my cup of tea but the motivation, support and guidance that I received from the Academy helped me a lot to work hard, pass out with flying colours and keep up to the expectations of everyone. Thank You VEA.

						<br>Vikram's English Academy is the ultimate place for learning English. I joined Vikram's English academy in 9th standard and since that day, my life has drastically changed. Vikram Sir makes learning so interesting that studying English is fun and enjoyable. I never wanted to miss any of his lectures. His innovative technique of teaching and jovial nature makes learning a very fascinating and delightful journey. He brought in the concept of learning grammar through music which made grammar very simple to learn. He makes our minds active so that we don't just memorize the facts and rules but understand the logic behind everything.<br>
