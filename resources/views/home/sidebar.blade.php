                            "I like a teacher who gives you something to take home to think about besides homework."<br>
                            This quote stands true to the experience of learning English at VEA because Vikramjit Sir is an
                            outstanding teacher who also teaches us those lessons that we would remember throughout our
                            lives. So it is hardly surprising that I enthusiastically attended all his classes for two years. We enjoyed every minute of every lecture and those creative techniques that Sir used like teaching the
                            rules of grammar through music. The way he explained the complex dialogues of the play and the meanings
                            with various examples, jokes and puns made learning English a wonderful experience. The test series and
                            endless grammar worksheets proved to be very beneficial to us. The notes provided by Sir are quite selfsufficient,up to the point and easy to understand. I only referred to these notes during exams and that helped me tremendously to keep the other clutter out of mind.<br>

                                It was super fun studying here. The audio-visual method of teaching helped   me remember stories very well. The keyword tests and the videos were an effective way of studying the 
                                Merchant of Venice. Moreover, last minute grammar tips and practice of loads of topics of writing skills was quite helpful. The testing method here with large number of practice papers helped me gain confidence in my preparation and it was quite precise. In short, academics at Vikram's English
                                Academy was very well planned to get students in line with English.
