To ignite their young minds with the fire to excel in exams and life, a special motivational lecture called 'Milestone' is kept in the month of September.

The only way to be perfect is by practicing hard. For this very reason we have created a special software by which they can solve exercises online and   the moment they submit their answers , they are given the solution to the exercise. Unlimited practice can be done in this way to perfect their prepositions.<br>
