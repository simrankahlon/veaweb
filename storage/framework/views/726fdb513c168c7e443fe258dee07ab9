                            <br>
                            This quote stands true to the experience of learning English at VEA because Vikramjit Sir is an
                            outstanding teacher who also teaches us those lessons that we would remember throughout our
                            lives. So it is hardly surprising that I enthusiastically attended all his classes for two years. We enjoyed every minute of every lecture and those creative techniques that Sir used like teaching the
                            rules of grammar through music. The way he explained the complex dialogues of the play and the meanings
                            with various examples, jokes and puns made learning English a wonderful experience. The test series and
                            endless grammar worksheets proved to be very beneficial to us. The notes provided by Sir are quite selfsufficient,up to the point and easy to understand. I only referred to these notes during exams and that helped me tremendously to keep the other clutter out of mind.<br>

                              would groom her to her optimum best..my search started and ended with Vikram's English
                              Academy. Vikramjit Sir is very passionate about imparting knowledge to his students. Manvi has not
                              missed a single class during her 10th and attended all with enthusiasm and eagerness. It helped
                              the students deliver their best !! Their helpline facility till the last moment of exam is appreciable.
                              This is truly a teacher's grace which helps students to go through this task with complete understanding
                              and preparation, with comfort and ease...Thank you Sir and thank you VEA for all your support

                                It was super fun studying here. The audio-visual method of teaching helped   me remember stories very well. The keyword tests and the videos were an effective way of studying the 
                                Merchant of Venice. Moreover, last minute grammar tips and practice of loads of topics of writing skills was quite helpful. The testing method here with large number of practice papers helped me gain confidence in my preparation and it was quite precise. In short, academics at Vikram's English
                                Academy was very well planned to get students in line with English.

                            When I first joined VEA in the ninth grade , it was just another class for me but now I can say it's
                            so much more than merely a class. My experience at VEA has been unforgettable. Vikramjeet Sir's
                            way of teaching, sharing his incredible thoughts and perspectives in every lecture, made it
                            surprisingly and suddenly so simple for me. All these 2 years, I never felt the need to mug up answers
                            or feel demotivated because of one small failed attempt ; thanks to his incredible lectures, the study
                            material - the VEA textbook, the keyword tests, revision, doubt solving lectures, the MOV videos, the grammar tests and multiple question papers and answers keys on the website, the MILESTONE lecture and the list is endless. I remember how even at 3 AM, the night before our board exams, both Kripa Madam and Sir were replying on whats app to the 1000's of doubts we had .

                             concerned about all my exams and even after the results were out, his good wishes paid off to give me a
                             1- mark increase in rechecking! These two years were a combined effort- Vikram Sir's expertise and VEA's efficiency to bring out the best in everyone.<br>
