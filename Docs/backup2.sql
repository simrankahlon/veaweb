The 6-second video showed a dot, presumably how a smartphone display would detect a touch on the display, dragging down slowly from the middle of the screen and then without lifting the finger, dragging up while retracing the same path.It is likely that the gesture-based system will be similar to the system in Apple iPhone X.
