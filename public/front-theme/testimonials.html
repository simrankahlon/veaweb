English was not my cup of tea but because of Sir's hardwork and faith, it became my strength. The test series and prelims were taken in such a manner that it covered all topics and gave us time to focus on every chapter. Corrections were done so well that we got to know even our smallest mistakes so that we avoid them in future. This along with the doubt solving sessions made us thorough with our concepts .Besides, Sir also gave his time individually to all those who required some extra help. <br>
          <br>
          He even made us solve prelim papers of various schools which brought our thinking to a different level. The way he teaches Shakespeare with realistic examples, videos, comparisons and practicality made me fall in love with 'Merchant of Venice'. Sir's puns &amp; playing with words made the lecture very interesting and full of fun. The LMR sheets and the doubt solving till the last minute was a 'Manna' for all of us. He not only has academically helped us but has also taught moral lessons of life. <br>
          <br>
          The ‘Milestone Lecture’ is the best example which became a game changer of our lives. It boosted our confidence. He moulds his students in such a beautiful manner that they learn to think unique and different from others n that’s the best about him. Learning at VEA <strong>(Vikram’s English Academy)</strong>, we don’t need to burden ourselves at all. It has been an honour to learn from Vikram Sir and to be a part of VEA. <br>

        <li>Janvi could excel in English & get a 96/100 only because of the motivation and encouragement given by Vikram Sir. His approach and outlook towards his work is absolutely commendable. This improved my daughter's writing and language skills. Sir doesn’t teach only for the sake of teaching but because he loves and enjoys teaching his dear students. <br>
<br>
That's the very reason he never missed his lectures not even on his birthday. He finds happiness with his students. He solves all doubts and difficulties with a smile and patiently listens to every parent that approach him for help. I feel very happy that my daughter has that person as an inspiration who defines hard work and conviction towards work. He is indeed every student's HERO.I thank his academy and wish him all the luck for I am sure there would be many outstanding achievers with him in the coming years. <br>

It's been something I've never experienced before. There was not a single lecture where I dozed off. Sir makes sure that every child is present not only physically but also mentally. English grammar was taught through music and for the first time, I actually learnt the rules of grammar. Sir has a very innovative way of teaching where even the most boring topic becomes an area of interest for you. We were shown the entire Merchant of Venice in the form of a movie which helped us retain it a lot better. Grammar and drama feel more like family now than just lessons in a book. Sir was always ready to clear our doubts even if it was at 4 in the morning. Without his encouragement a 96 in English would still be only a dream. The Last Minute Revision sheets were a complete summation of the entire board portion and that really helped in the end. The best teachers teach from the heart and not from the book. That defines Vikramjit Sir in a sentence. Thank you for everything Sir. You will always be an inspiration to me.<br>

    <li><img src="images/vedantchavan.jpg" width="132" height="133" class="leftimg">I had made up my mind to join Vikram's English Academy soon after my 8th Grade. It has been amazing to be a part of Vikram's English Academy for two whole years. Not just English, but there was a lot that I took along with me when I walked out of Vikram's English Academy. The kind of help and support that Vikramjit Sir provided me with, made me feel like a family. But at the same time, discipline was also taken care of. Without those grammar worksheets, essay writing, letter writing and frequent tests, I wouldn't have been able to reach 94 in English. I can never forget how patient and available Vikramjit Sir was to solve our doubts.During the pressure time when I was damn worried about Physics, Mathematics and all other subjects, I was calm and sure about English. I can say I was not at all tense about English subject and all Thanks to Vikramjit Sir. It was Vikram Sir's hard work which pushed us over the bar and everything went so well with English subject. <br>
<br>
Vikramjit Sir is like a father figure to me. My love and respect for "The Vikramjit Sir" increased excessively after the ‘Milestone Lecture’. I can still remember each and every word that he spoke on that day. Believe me, he made us believe that shaping our lives, the way we wanted was so simple. Vikramjit Sir always had something to surprise us with. It was either a list of essays that we had to write or even a surprise test. I have seen the change in myself. I have learnt so many things from Vikramjit Sir that I will be reminded of him for my entire life. He is the best teacher one can ever have. 
Thank You Sir for........ everything.

    <li><img src="images/khushidama.jpg" width="132" height="133" class="leftimg">A good teacher explains. A superior teacher demonstrates. Agreat teacher inspires. And, that's what Vikramjit Sir did to me. He became my inspiration. Before joining his academy, I used to consider English as a subject that only has stories to read; but after joining the academy I started playing a role in those stories and drama. Sir not only made us love but also live the language.I remember when he started teaching us ‘Merchant of Venice’, if we would not understand a part he could read the expressions on our faces and taught that part in another language so as to get it. Wow!! That's like a multi-talented Sir. <br>
<br>
While conducting the exams, he would understand the student psychology that we children couldn't study everything at one go and so his mini test series made it super easy to give our prelims. That's the way he understood us and so we were gifted a ‘Milestone Lecture’ which became the turning point of my life that time he not only connected with us as a teacher but also was a true inspiration. Lastly the LMR sheets were so helpful that if given earlier we need not have opened the text book and straight away given the exam. However as you always say "To be the best you need to do everything." So rightly said a good teacher is like a candle. It consumes itself to light the way for others. And for this I would like to thank him for lighting my future.<br>

Vikram Sir is not just a teacher, he's a friend, a guide, a motivator and a father figure.Without he's support and trust in me, I would not have reached this great score in English board exams. There were times when I lost hope and I became demotivated... it was Vikram Sir who re-instilled confidence in me.  When I myself did not believe that I could cross 90 in English boards, he was sure that I would be somewhere in the toppers list. <br>
<br>
The learning method, the tests conducted, the correction, the doubt clearing sessions and last minute revision helped us a lot. Learning Shakespeare in a funny way was just amazing. Revising the whole play in just a day before the board exam was just next to impossible for us students.  To make our work easier Vikram sir himself prepared LMR (Last minute revision) sheets of both, the drama and poetry, which helped us a ton. The ‘Milestone Lecture’ gave us inspiration to work harder. The way in which our papers and essays were corrected helped us know the loopholes and mistakes in our writing. Truly Vikram's English Academy is the best.<br>

I don't know where to start from. To the world you're a teacher but to all your students you are a true hero. You always taught from your heart and not from the book. I remember each and every lecture we had together where all your jokes with pun made us laugh so hard. The duration of one hour fifteen minutes seemed so less when youopened the door and entered like a superstar every time. The same one hour and fifteen minutes seemed so boring when it was any teacher from ***** classes. Your mere presence in the class spread a positive vibe. Your help, your guidance, your faith in each and every student, your encouragement just added to all of it. Your "Ab yeh kaise samjhau" at Gratiano's dialogues and a crystal clear explanation of each and every dialogue made ‘Merchant of Venice’ a part of our lives at such an extent that we still remember each and every dialogue. <br>

When my dad decides what I have to do I still say okay, “Let joy be the consequence” and he seems confused. When mom feels I am lying I still utter “By thy eyes I swear” and she just rolls her eyes. You and MOV will always be evergreen in my life and yeah there never has been a teacher like you never will be. When someone says they are joining ******* Madam or any other classes I just say that he or she has just lost their minds. Your last minute encouragement rings in my ears and your words were “You will easily crack 90+ " and when I saw my results a strong “Yesssss!!!!” came from my mouth . I felt so happy to score 94 in English just because of you. You're the best Sir, I couldn't have got any better teacher. Vikram's English Academy rocks and once again thank you so so so so much for everything. We love you a lot<br>

I had never been to English classes before and the experience was unexpected. I had never expected a Sir so friendly, and one who is always ready to solve doubts and give in his 100% to everything he does. He has been the light to guide us on the right path and it is a blessing to be able to learn from Vikramjit Sir himself. Not only does he teach literary knowledge but also the necessary values one needs in future like punctuality. I have never complained about attending class as sir makes learning fun and easy; every class was different in its own way. The chapterwise tests and test series were beneficial to me as the mistakes were solved and it was made sure we never repeat the same mistake. Whenever we had doubts, Vikramjit Sir has put in so many efforts to make sure we understand each and every thing crystal clear. The ‘Milestone Lecture’ really helped me change my whole attitude towards life and tenth board exam. The last minute notes made by Sir were like the cherry on top of the pie.<br>

    <li>It is truly a privilege and honour to say a few words about Vikram Sir and his illustrious Academy. Vikram's English Academy focuses on inculcating a flair and aptitude for English as a language in the minds of the students with excellence as its final objective. This is achieved by seamlessly integrating innovative teaching techniques, technology and lucid explanation enabling stories come live, poems critically analyzed and Shakespeare classic articulately deciphered. Students attend the sessions with enthusiasm and the periodic assessments help them to perform with élan and utmost confidence. <br>
      <br>
      We had reached out to Vikram Sir at the end of Term-I of Grade 9. The first sign of a caring institution was evident to us, when we were given a patient hearing on what had bought us there and our needs of the child. The fact that we never felt out of place or being favoured highlighted the character of the academy. Anukhool enthusiastically attended his biweekly sessions and remedial coaching that was offered to him. It is heartwarming to state that Vikram Sir takes ownership in helping the child overcome the difficulties and work alongside with the parents. We say all this with lot of personal conviction. <br>
      <br>
      Anukhool would not have scored 90 in English without all these above stated enablers. Would also like to extend sincere appreciation to Sir for taking time out to express his best wishes to every single student, making himself available 24/7 and tirelessly solving last minute queries during the final Boards. Thus playing the role of emotional anchor and morale booster to a hilt. Last but not the least, the stupendous results of the Academy year after year, amplifies Sir's commitment, dedication and sincerity towards his profession. Wishing Vikram's English Academy, glorious days ahead. We would remain proud of our brief association with Sir and his Academy and cherish the same. <br>

It is like a home full of learning, fun, emotions, memories and Vikramjit Sir himself…which makes the family complete. I became a part of this academy in 8th standard, when I used to think that English is not my cup of tea...but learning at Vikram English Academy made me confident about the subject. I would have even never thought about 95% in English till I got a complete support and awesome guidance from Vikramjit  Sir. Its not just a typical learning class but also a class which teaches us punctuality, mannerism etc. <br>
    	  <br>
    	  The milestone lecture removed the stress that I took for my tenth and made me confident and clear towards my way of approach in the near future. The tests, homework used to cover the whole chapter…and the question-answer session in class solved all the doubts. Learning with technology is one of the best ideas. <br>
    	  <br>
    	  We can see the images of the words written in the book which are sometimes difficult to understand and visualize and also videos of books like Shakespeare which require understanding but visual learning too. The hard work was constant throughout from the starting till the end without any obstacle. Sir’s dramatisationa nd voice modulation while teaching Shakespraere in the class made the topic even more interesting and memorable. The doubt solving lectures one day before the exams were the really benefecial. The musical learning was also helpful to make the tough grammar interesting and precise. This academy strengthened my English from its roots. I am very thankful to Vikramjit  Sir for his guidance for whole three years… <br>

  <p><img src="images/rutujabhosale.jpg" width="132" height="133" class="leftimg">Till ninth standard I never thought that I will get 97% in Board Exams. Actually I did not expect so much. It was some teachers in school and Vikramjit  Sir who had confidence in me that I can get above 95. At a moment I thought, If they can believe in me so much then why can't I believe in myself. People around us influence us in different ways.  A lot of positive and encouraging people around me was one of the reasons for my success. Those were my parents and Vikramjit  Sir.<br>
    <br>
    It was told to us by the school teachers that during holidays, we should study at least 12 hrs a day. The time when I use to watch TV, the time when I used to go out was used for studying. I was stressed out and started thinking that I cannot remember whatever I was studying. As overdoing something  has a bad effect, same thing happened with me. I and my parents approached Vikramjit  Sir regarding this matter. He is the best counsellor I have ever met. His counselling as if changed my way of studying. <br>
    <br>
    Realising that my pattern &amp; studying was totally wrong, I inserted breaks in my schedule. In that break time, I did whatever I liked most . This helped me a lot. I never missed the lectures of Vikrams English Academy because Sir's teaching technique was  unique and interesting. Grammar, which I used to find boring was made fun as he made us remember all the rules in grammar in the form of songs. The essay discussions in the class changed my method of writing essays. Sir made every topic interesting and used a lot of proverbs. Prelims and test series held were really beneficial. Sir's checking was perfect and all the doubts were cleared.<br>
    <br>
    The beautiful milestone lecture is the one which cannot be described in words. It will make you realise that life is beautiful and will motivate you. The one thing which I like the most about Sir is that he is not biased about anyone. He treats every student equally.<br>
    <br>
    Vikrams English Academy played a key role in my 10th std. Journey. The journey from 75% in IXth to 97% in Xth was full of obstacles. It needed  hard work but more than that, it required smart work. The only place where success comes before work is dictionary.<br>
    <br>
    97% was not the only thing which made me happy. The real success for me was the happiness in my parents’ eye and Vikramjit Sir telling me that I can be an inspiration for my juniors.It meant a lot to me. <br>

    <li><img src="images/atharvakulkarni.jpg" width="132" height="133" class="leftimg">I had joined Vikram’s English Academy only for one year and it was the last year of my school life. Things that I have learned in this one year are such that I couldn’t  not have learned in 2 or 3 years elsewhere. The pattern of teaching, the way of correction, the tests , the prelims, the extra time that sir invested in us was helpful, rather amazing. There is a talent hidden in each one of us . How to get it out is an art that Vikramjit Sir knows the best. English was not very easy for me to study but as sir had done his part of the job really well , paying attention to my problems specifically, I blindly followed whatever he had said in the class. He proved to me something that I did not believe much in then, and that was the importance of practice. Whether  it be 2o clock in the night or 6 o clock in the morning, he was there to clear our doubts when it mattered most. Apart from the lessons in English we have learnt lessons for life. Paying attention to each and every word of his will make you really knowledgeable. He is a powerhouse of  information. Am proud to  have received the  Champion of Change  trophy after jumping from 47 to 94 % in English in just one year.<br>

         <br>
         His teaching, notes are the best. He entertains all types of doubts. He is available 24/7 to us. Most noteworthy thing in his teaching is that he made use of songs, videos, pictures for every single poem, story, scene in Shakespeare or chapter in Grammar. Every year he found new ways of teaching the same Grammar lessons. His topic wise test, assignments and prelims were useful for analyzing mistakes. Assignments and test papers were corrected in less than 1 week. During lectures we did not just constantly studied, we had discussions on current affairs etc. Time to time he has been very instrumental in motivating us to study. Fever, Headache never stopped Vikramjit  sir from cancelling lectures. His Milestone lecture was best teacher's day gift to us.<br>
         <br>
       </p>
       <p>He is an all rounder...along with an English Teacher, a counselor, an advisor, Vikram sir has been best buddy. This kind of hard work is not done by reputed***** classes. Thank you for the entire uphill struggle you have put into teaching and guiding me to achieve excellent results.</p>

My journey in his  institution started with petty failures but  ended into a grand success. Beyond being my English tutor, a grammar wizard,  an exceptional conversationalist there is  something rare in him- he is  blessed  with the ability to recognize other&rsquo;s ability. Never seen a teacher sharing his  life experiences with their students   being so relevant. <br>
    <br>
My journey in his  institution did start with many failures. But  even while enduring failure he burned like a catalyst to race me  toward my success. Never had I thought that  music would be my friend in remembering those complicated grammar rules or the  live telecast of tearing out prelim papers help me complete my literature paper  on time during boards. I do remember his  milestone lecture wherein he  dint try to change students but channel them  to change  their ways. His  tact of memorizing things &ldquo;by heart&rdquo; worked  well for learning those Shakespearean dialogues. His teaching us the short  stories using spatial intelligence made it a cakewalk for me to attempt my  sixteen marker in boards. The  ingredient  in his  conversation was truth, next the  good sense, third good humor and fourth wit.<br>
<br>
His  unusual teaching methods using music,  answering late night student doubts one day prior examination, spontaneity of  answering before we finished our questions and regular revision sessions before  class enabled me pass my board with flying colors. I thank him for being my  tutor, mentor and a friend all when I needed it the most. Hope to hold his teachings  in my heart life- long and be a better person fulfilling all his expectations  with all his blessings.<br>

We not only learnt what was their in our syllabus but we also learnt things which were related to our lives. I never knew we could learn grammar with music. This method helped me a lot. The 'MILESTONE' lecture was a turning point of my life. I learnt that 10th boards was not the end of life, infact it was the first stepping stone towards success. Yes, I achieved success in English. The command over my English is all because of Sir. I before never scored well in essays but at the end of my journey i scored 22 out of 25. Sir has the best teaching methods. Every lecture he used new methods to simply the concept of learning something,let is be Shakespeare or any story or poem he taught everything in a best way. Sir is a precious gem who loves all his students equally.<br>

Post 9th Std the struggle to get the best teachers outside of school began. There were so many options ,but everyone looks for the best. Then there came Vikram’s English Academy and its associated teachers of other subjects at JCP mulund. Everyone seemed to talk very good about all the teachers at Jcp I made up my mind to get on to the band wagon, but trust me it was one of the best decisions of my life. <br>
     <br>
     My 365 days with one person called Vikramjit sir was one of my best time in my life. 
Every English medium student knows English but the really understanding of the language and drama came to me from Vikramjit Sir .<br>
<br>
Not only the authenticity of the language but I was also exposed to confidence building, Expression and personality development. From a student I could look up on ,me becoming a good orator. All this was only due to the unconditional support and unending teaching which went up to 4am on  the exam day.

      Vikramjit  sir was not a just a teacher for us but also our guide, our mentor throughout the year and even a great friend who always supported us in all the things.

He made it too simple and a lot of fun for us.

    	  <br>
    	  As Vikram sir constantly told me, I was born with a flair for English. But it was only under sir’s constant guidance and support that I could go from ‘good’ to ‘better’ and thereon.<br>
    	  <br>
    	  He is one of the few gems who has been blessed with brilliance. He is an excellent teacher, one who makes Shakespearean English seem like a cakewalk .He is a supportive mentor, one who will hold your hand and guide you like the polestar. He is a friend in every need. At the  same time, he is that shrewd professor who will not hesitate to discipline you when you commit a mistake. A man of so many colours . It has been an honour to learn from him.<br>
    	  <br>
    	  His teaching is legendary. Paper correction is perfect. The question papers are set in the same pattern as the board. No mistake is overlooked. No doubt is left is uncleared .Sir gives his 100% . The only  gap that lies between the student and success has to be overcome by that students effort.<br>
    	  <br>
    	  Saving the very best for the last , is sir’s MILESTONE lecture. It adds perspective to the student’s life. It gives a new vision .<br>

       Ria was a good student at English. But she excelled when Vikram sir saw the talent in her and continuously motivated her and pushed her forward throughout the year, even on the day of English board exam paper. He transformed her from just ‘good’ student in English to his incredible girl who scored a 95/100 in her boards, missing the board highest by merely 1 mark. <br>
       <br>
       His teaching, outstanding as it is has helped Ria tremendously in improving her language and writing skills over the last 2 years. But the thing about Vikram Sir that I love, is the method of teaching. They say that a person learns only when he is involved. Sir put the rules of ‘voice’ and ‘tense’ into the tunes of songs which helped children immensely to understand and recollect them faster. What better examples one need ?  He solves children’s difficulties with  asmile. He patiently listens to every parent and accepts suggestions with  an open heart.
       <br>
       <br>
       He isn’t just a teacher to these children ,he is their HERO . The hero that doesn’t need wings. He can fly with the love that his kids give him.
       <br>
       <br>
       He emphasizes on teaching the right way and imparting value education, respecting children, treating them as equal  entities in their own right. When I ask him when he is happiest, he smiles and answers promptly “When I am with children and see them radiating the pure joy of learning”<br>
       <br>
I wish his academy all the best for the years to come and I am sure he will produce many more outstanding results and Vikram’s English Academy will attract the students who aspire to be the best.

      Believing you can do it, you deserve it, believing you will get it….because…there is no elevator to success …. You need to take the stairs.”<br>
      <br>
….I think that this would best define Vikramjit Sir. Our Bible for English. It was a matter of great esteem to have been a part of Vikram’s  English Academy .No doubt about the fact that he has proved to be the most hardworking tutor ever. The journey at your academy was a completely different one. Each and every quality that  sir possessed…was just out of the box.
<br>
<br>
As far as teaching is concerned, I would give Vikram’s English  Academy my first and only choice. The amount of  hardwork done by  sir is just immeasurable .Each and every student of his, is special for him. personal attention…he used to sit with us as long as we wanted to clear doubts, that too even for one student. No other does this much for his students. Each and every question paper being personally prepared and corrected by him… sounds to be impossible but is true.  And even after all this …. he used to sit with his students to discuss and spot out the mistakes.
<br>
<br>
Even if a student calls him at midnight… he is there to answer his students .This shows the amount of care that he possessed for us. He has been a candle that consumes itself to light way for others. For him...sky is the limit. Each and every child used to feel so motivated in his company.
<br>
<br>
‘Milestone’ lecture was the best gift ever given by a teacher to his students. You changed our thought process in just two hours. The lecture has left a deep impact on our minds. We realized that 10th is not the only important step, but the first important step to success. People in the world have to face much much more….and are problems are too tiny… in fact; those are not  to be called as problems. You actually made us realize the importance of our parents.
<br>
<br>
The best part… he always stood up in support of  his students …. No matter what … he lifted  one out of the worst of all situations…. We really respect him… he followed his curiosity, lived in the moment… had a completely different sense of perseverance… he is a perfect model to take inspiration from….<br>
<br>
All the credit of our success goes to him….. because he excels in his subject and I can bet on the fact that no tutor can be better at English grammar than him…..!!
<br>
<br>
I really wish that Vikram’s English Academy goes on …. the same way…. Forever!!

All the praise for him …. is too less….!

“Two roads diverged in the yellow woods….

And today… that is what has made all the difference…..!

      <br>
      <br>
      I have been studying in this academy since the past one year and it has been a pleasure to learn here. I always thought that languages, and mainly English, were my poor subjects but my mindset changed gradually  and as of today, I feel confident to converse in English and get compliments on my fluency too. Leaving aside the academic performance, what helped me throughout the journey of my tenth was the ‘Milestone’ lecture and the conversations during lectures between us and Vikram sir.
      <br>
      <br>
      The ‘Milestone’ lecture was immensely beneficial to me in setting my goals/aims up and I feel proud to announce that I was able to achieve them, just how I wanted it to be. I still remember the tears running down my cheeks while experiencing life in the span of that lecture. The other name I would give   ‘Milestone’ is  ‘The motivation’.
      <br>
      <br>
      Not only the milestone has helped me achieve my target but it is also my result of sincere and sheer hard work of Vikram Sir. Homework assignments on each topic tests, two- three prelims before boards and even the periodic doubt solving lectures, everything was like climbing steps towards my destination.
      <br>
      <br>
      For my success today in English I will give only 10% credit to myself, my hard work and intelligence . The rest 90% goes to Vikram sir and his efforts. According to me, to score well you need develop the interest in subject firstly, which job in my case was responsibility performed by Sir due to which an urge to study English developed in my mind. The tests made me realize that I could do it in English too. Vikram sir was the only person so sure that I could get above 95% aggregate in boards, who had recognize my capacity much earlier and he has never failed to show me the way to achieve it.<br>

English was not my cup of tea but because of Sir's hardwork and faith, it became my strength.
